        <h>A little bit about me!</h>
    <br>
    <p>I am an alumni of Girard High School which is in Pennsylvania.  
    I lived there my whole life and played soccer a majority of my life
    even today.  I like listening to music and working out, and late night 
    drives, they feel theraputic.  I have 3 dogs an a brother as well.</p>
